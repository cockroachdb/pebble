// rateCalculator computes the target deletion throughput (bytes/sec) for a
// paced deleter. It maintains a baseline rate and adds a corrective "backlog
// component" using a constant-horizon drain model:
//
//   - Feed-forward: assume the next short interval will see new deletions at the
//     same average rate as the recent window (RecentRateWindow).
//
//   - Backlog drain: if a queue backlog is observed (or disk free space is
//     below a threshold), add just enough extra rate to eliminate that deficit
//     within a configured timeframe, and *hold that extra rate* until cleared.
//
// The calculator also tracks "debt": bytes from already-initiated deletions that
// we must wait out to respect the current pacing rate. Debt decays at the
// current rate over time, and callers can query how long to pause before
// starting the next deletion.
