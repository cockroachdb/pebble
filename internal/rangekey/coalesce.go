// Coalesce imposes range key semantics and coalesces range keys with the same
// bounds. Coalesce drops any keys shadowed by more recent sets, unsets or
// deletes. Coalesce modifies the provided span's Keys slice, reslicing the
// slice to remove dropped keys.
//
// Coalescence has subtle behavior with respect to sequence numbers. Coalesce
// depends on a keyspan.Span's Keys being sorted in sequence number descending
// order. The first key has the largest sequence number. The returned coalesced
// span includes only the largest sequence number. All other sequence numbers
// are forgotten. When a compaction constructs output range keys from a
// coalesced span, it produces at most one RANGEKEYSET, one RANGEKEYUNSET and
// one RANGEKEYDEL. Each one of these keys adopt the largest sequence number.
//
// This has the potentially surprising effect of 'promoting' a key to a higher
// sequence number. This is okay, because:
//   - There are no other overlapping keys within the coalesced span of
//     sequence numbers (otherwise they would be in the compaction, due to
//     the LSM invariant).
//   - Range key sequence numbers are never compared to point key sequence
//     numbers. Range keys and point keys have parallel existences.
//   - Compactions only coalesce within snapshot stripes.
//
// Additionally, internal range keys at the same sequence number have subtle
// mechanics:
//   - RANGEKEYSETs shadow RANGEKEYUNSETs of the same suffix.
//   - RANGEKEYDELs only apply to keys at lower sequence numbers.
//
// This is required for ingestion. Ingested sstables are assigned a single
// sequence number for the file, at which all of the file's keys are visible.
// The RANGEKEYSET, RANGEKEYUNSET and RANGEKEYDEL key kinds are ordered such
// that among keys with equal sequence numbers (thus ordered by their kinds) the
// keys do not affect one another. Ingested sstables are expected to be
// consistent with respect to the set/unset suffixes: A given suffix should be
// set or unset but not both.
//
// The resulting dst Keys slice is sorted by InternalKeyTrailer.
