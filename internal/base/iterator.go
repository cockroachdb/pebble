// InternalIterator iterates over a DB's key/value pairs in key order. Unlike
// the Iterator interface, the returned keys are InternalKeys composed of the
// user-key, a sequence number and a key kind. In forward iteration, key/value
// pairs for identical user-keys are returned in descending sequence order. In
// reverse iteration, key/value pairs for identical user-keys are returned in
// ascending sequence order. Bounds, [lower, upper), can be set on iterators,
// either using the SetBounds() function in the interface, or in implementation
// specific ways.
//
// An iterator must be closed after use, but it is not necessary to read an
// iterator until exhaustion.
//
// An iterator is not necessarily goroutine-safe, but it is safe to use
// multiple iterators concurrently, with each in a dedicated goroutine.
//
// It is also safe to use an iterator concurrently with modifying its
// underlying DB, if that DB permits modification. However, the resultant
// key/value pairs are not guaranteed to be a consistent snapshot of that DB
// at a particular point in time.

	// SeekGE moves the iterator to the first key/value pair whose key is greater
	// than or equal to the given key. Returns the key and value if the iterator

	// only checks the upper bound. It is up to the caller to ensure that key
	// is greater than or equal to the lower bound.

	// SeekPrefixGE moves the iterator to the first key/value pair whose key
	// starts with the given prefix and is greater than or equal to the given
	// key. Returns the key and value if the iterator is pointing at a valid
	// entry, and (nil, nil) otherwise. Note that the iterator will still observe
	// keys not matching the prefix. It is up to the user to check if the prefix
	// matches, and iteration beyond the prefix is undefined. Note that
	// SeekPrefixGE only checks the upper bound. It is up to the caller to
	// ensure that key is greater than or equal to the lower bound.

	// the lower bound. It is up to the caller to ensure that key is less than
	// the upper bound.

	// First moves the iterator the the first key/value pair. Returns the key and

	// caller to ensure that key is greater than or equal to the lower bound
	// (e.g. via a call to SeekGE(lower)).
	First() (*InternalKey, []byte)

	// Last moves the iterator the the last key/value pair. Returns the key and

	// caller to ensure that key is less than the upper bound (e.g. via a call
	// to SeekLT(upper))
	Last() (*InternalKey, []byte)

	// Next moves the iterator to the next key/value pair. Returns the key and

	// caller to ensure that key is greater than or equal to the lower bound.

	// Prev moves the iterator to the previous key/value pair. Returns the key
	// and value if the iterator is pointing at a valid entry, and (nil, nil)

	// caller to ensure that key is less than the upper bound.

	// all the key/value pairs in a table is not considered to be an error.
	// It is valid to call Close multiple times. Other methods should not be
	// called after the iterator has been closed.
	Close() error
