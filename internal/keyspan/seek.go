	//
	// The cases to consider:
	//
	// 1. search-key == "a"
	//   - The search key is fully before any span. We should return an
	//     empty span. The initial SeekLT("a") will return iterKey==nil and
	//     the next span [d,h) lies fully after the search key.
	//
	// 2. search-key == "d"
	//   - The search key is contained by the span [d,h). We want to return
	//     the newest version of the span [d,h) or the empty span if
	//     there are no visible versions. The initial SeekLT("d") will return
	//     iterKey==nil and the next span [d,h) contains the search key. We
	//     iterate forward from there returning the newest visible span for
	//     [d, h) and if there is no visible one return an empty span.
	//
	// 3. search-key == "h" or "i"
	//   - The search key lies between the spans [d,h) and [j,n). We want to
	//     return the newest visible version of the span [d,h) or the empty
	//     span if there are no visible versions. The initial SeekLT("h") or
	//     SeekLT("i") will return the span [d,h)#1. Because the end key of
	//     this span is less than or equal to the search key we have to
	//     check if the next span contains the search key. In this case it
	//     does not and we need to look backwards starting from [d, h)#1, falling
	//     into case 5.
	//
	// 4. search-key == "n"
	//   - The search key is contained by the span [n,r). We want to return
	//     the newest version of the span [n,r) or an earlier span if
	//     there are no visible versions of [n,r). The initial SeekLT("n") will
	//     return the span [j,n)#1. Because the end key of the spans
	//     [j,n) equals the search key "n" we have to see if the next span
	//     contains the search key (which it does). We iterate forward through
	//     the [n,r) spans (not beyond) and return the first visible
	//     span (since this iteration is going from newer to older). If
	//     there are no visible [n,r) spans (due to the snapshot parameter)
	//     we need to step back to [n,r) and look backwards, falling into case 5.
	//
	// 5. search-key == "p"
	//   - The search key is contained by the span [n,r). We want to return
	//     the newest visible version of the span [n,r) or an earlier
	//     span if there are no visible versions. Because the end key of the
	//     span [n,r) is greater than the search key "p", we do not have to
	//     look at the next span. We iterate backwards starting with [n,r),
	//     then [j,n) and then [d,h), returning the newest version of the first
	//     visible span.
