# This datadriven test uses a single command 'build' that illustrates a sequence
# of calls to a fragmenter.
#
# 'add' lines add a new span with the provided sequence number and the provided
# bounds. 'add' outputs nothing.
#
# 'deleted' lines test whether the provided key is deleted by a RANGEDEL in the
# fragmenter when read at the trailing snapshot sequence number.
