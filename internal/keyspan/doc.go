// Package keyspan provides facilities for sorting, fragmenting and
// iterating over spans of user keys.
//
// A Span represents a range of user key space with an inclusive start
// key and exclusive end key. A span's start key is an internal key,
// meaning it contains both an internal key kind and a sequence number.
//
// Spans are used within Pebble as an in-memory representation of range
// deletion tombstones. Spans are fragmented at overlapping key
// boundaries by the Fragmenter type. This package's various iteration
// facilities require these non-overlapping fragmented spans.
