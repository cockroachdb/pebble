# Test case discovered during implementation of the optimization
# An example of this edge case would be RangeDel, however there can be other
# instances that might produce the same scenario
# consider the heap has a key with s@5 SET
# SSTable 1                                         SSTable 2
# a@3#SET - s@8 RangeDel                 s@8#SET - w@7#SET
#
# In this scenerio if we have SeekPrefixGE at for example s@11. 
# This case will return s@3 as the synthetic key.
# Heap, -> s@5 SET, s@3 SYNTHETIC. We miss s@8, since we detected presence of s@8
# in table 1, we produced s@3#SYNTHETIC but the key was never present in the table.
# To Fix this we must make sure that prefix is wholly contained within the sstable's bounds 
# so that prevent wrong seeks in case of false loads.

# Test case back to back SeekPrefixGE call
# We discovered that performing back to back SeekPrefixGE calls will cause 
# Try seeking optimization to trigger, and we will miss the latest key
# Consider the following scenario, 
# SeekPrefixGE(as@16), we will make synthetic keys and finally return the result for the key
# When peroforming a subsequent SeekPrefixGE(ay@16), we trigger the tryseekingusingnext optimization
# now we will miss the key ay@16, since we return nil because the next key is actually a synthetic key which was never positioned.
