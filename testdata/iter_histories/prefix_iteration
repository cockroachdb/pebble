# Regression test for a bug discovered in #1878.
# A lazy-combined iterator triggers combined iteration during an initial
# seek-prefix-ge call. The initial seek-prefix-ge call avoids defragmenting
# fragments beyond the initial fragment [c,f). A subsequent seek-ge that seeks
# within the bounds of the initial fragment [c,f) must not fall into the
# optimization that reuses the span without reseeking the keypsan iterator,
# because the span is not defragmented.
#
# In the bug surfaced by #1878, the initial seek-prefix-ge that switched to
# combined iteration failed to record that the iterator was now in prefix mode,
# allowing the subsequent seek-ge to incorrectly reuse the existing span.

# Regression test for an invariant violation in the range key defragmenting
# iterator during prefix iteration. [Related to #1893]. There is a lot of
# subtlety here. Do not modify this test case without verifying that it still
# exercises the right conditions.
#
# Normally during forward iteration, if a switch to lazy-combined iteration is
# triggered, the lazy-combined iterator establishes a seek key for the range key
# iterator such that the seek key is:
#   1. greater than or equal to the key at previous iterator position.
#   2. less than or equal to the first range key with a start key greater than
#       or equal to the previous iterator position.
# These invariants are important so that the range key iterator is positioned
# appropriately after the switch to combined iteration and no range keys are
# missed.
#
# Parts of the iterator stack depend on the above invariants. For example,
# during forward iteration the BoundedIter only checks span start keys against
# iterator bounds and the configured prefix, with the expectation that the seek
# is always already greater than or equal to the lower bound. In turn, the
# DefragmentingIter indirectly relies on the same invariant, because it requires
# a consistent view of the fragments. If the BoundedIter returns a span in one
# direction, but skips it when iterating back, the defragmenting iterator will
# end up on a different fragment.
#
# This test exercises a case in which previously, during prefix iteration, it
# was possible for the switch to lazy-combined iteration to trigger using a seek
# key k, such that there exist range key fragments between the current iterator
# position and k (violating the 2nd invariant up above).
#
# The sequence of events is:
#   1. SeekPrefixGE("b@9") = 'b@4':
#      a. This seek positions the two levels, L0 and L6. The L0 iterator seeks
#         to file 000006. This file does not contain any keys with the prefix
#         "b", and the bloom filter must succeed in excluding the file. Since the
#         file contains a range deletion, SeekPrefixGE returns the level's
#         largest point key (`d#inf,RANGEDEL`) to ensure the file stays open until
#         the iterator advances past the range deletion.
#      b. In L6, the level iterator seeks to 000004 which contains a key with
#         the prefix, returning 'b@4'.
#   2. Next():
#      a. Next advances the L6 iterator to file 000005. This file contains a
#         range key [e,f)@1=bar, which updates the lazy-combined iterator's
#         state, recording the earliest observed range key as 'e'. The L6 level
#         iterator then returns the file single point key 'c'.
#      b. The merging iterator checks whether point key 'c' is deleted by any
#         range key deletions. It is. It's deleted by L0's [c,d) range deletion.
#         The merging iterator then seeks the iterator to the tombstone's end
#         key 'd'.
#      c. After seeking, the range deletion sentinel d is at the top of the
#         heap. At this point, the merging iterator checks whether the keyspace
#         of the prefix has been exceeded, and it has. It returns nil.
#   3. Switch to combined iteration:
#      a. The Next has completed and triggered combined iteration. The only file
#         containing range keys that was observed was 000005, containing the
#         range key [e,f). The switch to combined iteration seeks the keyspan
#         iterator to 'e'. Note that the iterator never observed L0's [d,e)
#         range key that precedes [e,f) in the keyspace.
#      b. Seeking the keyspan iterator calls DefragmentingIter.SeekLT('e'),
#         which lands on the [d,e) fragment. This fragment does NOT check to see
#         if the span starts at a prefix greater than the current prefix 'b',
#         because only bounds in the direction of iteration are check.
#      c. The DefragmentingIter observes disappearing range key fragments when
#         it switches directions, as a result of (b).
#
