# Regression test for #1963 / cockroachdb/cockroach#88296.
#
# The iterators in this test move their bounds monotonically forward
# [a,b)â†’[b,e). This enables the sstable iterator optimization for monotonically
# moving bounds (see boundsCmp in sstable/reader.go). With this optimization,
# the first seek after the SetBounds may use the fact that the bounds moved
# forward monotonically to avoid re-seeking within the index.
#
# The test cases below exercise a seek to a key, followed by a seek to a smaller
# key. The second seek should not make use of the bounds optimization because
# doing so may incorrectly skip all keys between the lower bound and the first
# seek key. Previously, the code paths that handled block-property filtering on
# a two-level iterator could leave the iterator in a state such that the second
# seek would improperly also exercise the monotonic bounds optimization. In the
# test cases below, this would result in the key 'b' not being found. Each test
# case exercises a different combination of seek-ge and seek-prefix-ge.

# Regression test for #2084.
#
# The optimization added in #2058 began using an enabled TrySeekUsingNext flag
# to avoid re-seeking within a level's file metadata. This optimization was
# dependent on the invariant that the iterator remained positioned at the
# previous seek key, so that a subsequent seek to a larger key does not need to
# backtrack.
#
# This invariant wasn't strictly preserved by the levelIter during SeekPrefixGE
# calls. During a SeekPrefixGE, the sstable iterator may return nil despite the
# existence of sstable keys greater than the seek key if the sstable's bloom
# filter excludes the seek prefix. If the sstable DOES NOT contain any range
# tombstones, the levelIter does not advance to the next file if the file's
# largest bound has a prefix larger than the seek prefix, returning nil, else it
# does advance since the next file could contain the seek prefix.
#
# However, if the file DOES contain range tombstones, the levelIter returns a
# synthetic largest boundary key so that the file remains open until the merging
# iterator passes beyond its bounds. This ensures the file's range deletions'
# effects on other keys are observed. If another level returned a key greater
# than this largest boundary key (eg, because the other level doesn't restrict
# results to the seek prefix), the merging iterator could step beyond the
# level's synthetic boundary key.  This step could advance the levelIter to the
# next file, despite its irrelevance to the current prefix. This step would also
# break the invariant that the level iterator remained positioned at the seek
# key.
#
# The bug was fixed by comparing the synthetic boundary key to the seek prefix,
# avoiding ever Next-ing the level iterator beyond the seek prefix.

# Set 100 bloom-filter bits per key to ensure the bloom-filter exclusivity
# checks successfully exclude prefixes that aren't present.

# The first SeekPrefixGE(b@3) positions each level iterator over their

#
# The second SeekPrefixGE(c@5) seeks in both files. The 0.0 level iterator finds
# that its file does not contain the prefix 'c', so it returns nil. Since the file
# contains a range deletion, it returns a synthetic boundary key with user key
# d@1 to ensure the file stays open until the iterator has moved beyond the

# tombstone c@0#4,DEL. This gets bubbled up to the Iterator, which skips it
# because it's a point tombstone, nexting within 000007 to e@0#5.
#
# Previously, in the bug highlighted by #2084, the merging iterator would then

# Regression test for #2118, where a MERGE pushes child iterators to the next

# This test constructs this example (suffixes ignored), where square brackets

#
# L0: [(b, MERGE)  (c-d, RANGEDEL)] [(m, DEL)]
# L6: [(c, SET) (c-e, RANGEKEYSET)] [(j, SET)]
#
# We create an iterator with L6 filters enabled and create relatively large

# and end up with the L0 levelIter landing on the (b, MERGE), and the L6 iterator
# is exhausted as no SST filter blocks match the prefix. The top-level iterator
# then Next()s to find the next internal key at b if there is any, we land
# on the pause key at (d, RANGEDELSENTINEL). Crucially since there are no
# more items in the mergingIter heap and the merging iter is set to elide
# range tombstones, we Next() the level iter again as part of the same top-level
# iterator Next(), and land on (m, DEL). The type of the key here doesn't really
# matter.
#
# We then do a SeekPrefixGE(c), and since c > b, in the buggy scenario we

# Regression test for Cockroachdb#92205. This test constructs this scenario:
#
# A DEL in a middle level (L0.0) that we SeekPrefixGE directly for. Note that
# this DEL is not deleted by any range deletes; it gets exposed to the
# Iterator. There's a key after this DEL in the L0.0 levelIter, and there's a
# level above it (L0.1) that has a rangedel deleting that key, but not the DEL
# we SeekPrefixGE for. In the lowest level, there's a SET at L6 that is to the
# right of the DEL in L0.0, but is also not deleted by the RANGEDEL in L0.1.
# Our second SeekPrefixGE will be for this SET. Visualization, where square
# brackets are files:
#
# L0.1                 [dd-ee#RANGEDEL]
# L0.0    [b#DEL          e#SET]
# L6            [d#SET]       [f#SET g#SET]
#
# When the Iterator encounters the above DEL internal key in the SeekPrefixGE, it
# calls Iterator.nextUserKey in the Iterator.findNextEntry call that was part of the
# SeekPrefixGE call. While Iterator.findNextEntry has a conditional to exit
# out of the loop if we're in prefix iteration and have gone past the prefix,
# this break only happens _after_ nextUserKey() has run. As a result we Next()
# the levelIter in L0.0, land on e#SET, and the mergingIter realizes that it
# is deleted by the rangedel in a higher level (L0.1). The mergingIter does not
# see d#SET because that sstable was excluded by the bloom filter. We then do a relative
# seek of all levels below L0.1 to ee (the end key of the rangedel), and in that
# process we advance the L6 levelIter to the second file.
#
# When we do the second SeekPrefixGE for d, the outer Iterator thinks d > b and
# so TrySeekUsingNext can work. However, the L6 levelIter has already advanced
# past the file containing d#SET, so we don't surface it even though we should
# have.
