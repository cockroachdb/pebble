# Define 3 DBs and ensure compactions occur in the correctly prioritized order.
# - dbs[0] has overlapping sstables in L5 and L6 and will be manually compacted.
# - dbs[1] is empty initially but will have overlapping files ingested into it,
#   triggering automatic compactions.
# - dbs[2] has multiple sstables in L6 which only contain DELs, which triggers
#   an elision-only compaction.
