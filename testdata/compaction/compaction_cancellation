# Try to manually compact all the files. Due to the parallel specification,
# this will create 3 manual compactions, the first of which, over the key span
# [a, c], is not blocked by the ongoing compaction, and will run. The second
# one, over the key span [d, e], is blocked, and also blocks the one over [f,
# g], due to head-of-line blocking. The test will wait until it observes 2
# blocked manual compactions, and the first manual compaction finishes, and
# will then cancel the compaction, which should be observed, and result in
# removal of the queued compactions.
