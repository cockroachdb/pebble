# Format for define command:
# Levels are ordered from higher to lower, and each new level starts with an L
# Each level is defined using an even number of lines where every pair of lines represents
# a file. The files within a level are ordered from smaller to larger keys.
# Each file is defined using: the first line specifies the smallest and largest internal
# keys and the second line the point key-value pairs in the sstable in order. The rangedel
# key-value pairs should also be in increasing order relative to the other rangedel pairs.
# The largest file key can take the form of <userkey>.RANGEDEL.72057594037927935, which
# represents the range deletion sentinel.

# The rangedel should not delete any points in any sstable.  The two files were involved in a
# compaction and then the second file got moved to a lower level.
