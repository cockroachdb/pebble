# These tests demonstrate the behavior of the tombstone density compaction feature
# in Pebble. This feature identifies files with a high density of tombstones and
# prioritizes them for compaction to improve read performance.
#
# A file is eligible for tombstone density compaction when:
# - Its TombstoneDenseBlocksRatio exceeds TombstoneDenseCompactionThreshold
# - The file has valid stats
# - The file is not already compacting
#
# The TombstoneDenseBlocksRatio is calculated during SSTable creation:
# - NumTombstoneDenseBlocks / NumDataBlocks
# - A block is considered "tombstone dense" if it meets criteria set by
#   NumDeletionsThreshold and DeletionSizeRatioThreshold
#
# Furthermore, there's a performance optimization. When a tombstone density compaction:
# - has a single input file with high tombstone density
# - there are no overlapping files in the target level
# - the overlapping bytes in the grandparent level are below MaxOverlapBytes
# - The input file is not at the second lowest level L5
# , the compaction can be optimized to simply move the file rather than rewriting it.
#
# The following test cases demonstrate this behavior in different scenarios.

# Test Case 1: Tombstone density compaction should only be optimized to move
# when output level is not the lowest level L6.
# Here we create a scenario where:
# - A file in L4 has high tombstone density
# - There are no overlapping files in L5
# - The overlapping bytes with L6 are below MaxOverlapBytes
#
# Expected behavior:
# - The compaction type should be "move" from L4 to L5
# - The file should be moved from L4 to L5 without rewriting
# - L5 to L6 should still be categorized as "tombstone-density" compaction
