// FlushGovernor is used to decide when to flush a block. It takes into
// consideration a target block size and (optionally) allocation size classes.

// When allocation size classes are used, we use the allocation class that is
// closest to the target block size. We also take into account the next
// allocation class and use it if it reduces internal fragmentation.

	// We always add another KV to a block if its initial size is below
	// lowWatermark (even if the block is very large after adding the KV). This is
	// a safeguard to avoid very small blocks in the presence of large KVs.
	lowWatermark int
	// We never add another KV to a block if its existing size exceeds
	// highWatermark (unless its initial size is < lowWatermark).

	// When using allocation classes, the high watermark corresponds to the
	// allocation size class that follows the target class. Otherwise, it
	// corresponds to the target block size.

// This value is the amount of extra bytes we allocate together with the block
// data. This must be taken into account when taking allocator size classes into
// consideration.
//
// For instance, we may have a block of size 1020B that by itself would fit
// within a 1024B class. However, when loaded into the block cache we also
// allocate space for the cache entry metadata. The new allocation may now only
// fit within a 2048B class, which increases internal fragmentation.

//
// 1. No allocation classes. If we don't have any allocatorSizeClasses, or
// targetBlockSize doesn't fit between two allocation classes, then we flush
// right before the block would exceed targetBlockSize (except if the block size
// would be smaller than blockSizeThreshold percent of the target, in which case
// we flush right after the target block size is exceeded).
//
// 2. With allocation classes. We take into account allocation size classes no
// smaller than sizeClassAwareThreshold percent of the target block size and up
// to the first class that fits the target block size. We flush near allocation
// class boundaries to minimize wasted memory space in the block cache (internal
// fragmentation).
//
// The FlushGovernor is immutable and can be copied by value.
