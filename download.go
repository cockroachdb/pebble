// downloadSpanTask tracks the task of downloading external files that overlap
// with a DownloadSpan.
//
// A downloadSpanTask is spawned only if at least one overlapping external file
// is found in the current version.
//
// When a downloadSpanTask completes (i.e. taskCompletedChan is signaled)
// without an error, it is guaranteed that all external files that were
// overlapping the download span at the beginning of the task are downloaded.
//
// == Implementation ==
//
// A download span task moves through the LSM within the given bounds in
// top-down level order (L0, L1, etc.), and in Smallest.UserKey order within
// each level (and breaking ties in L0 according to LargestSeqNum). We introduce
// the concept of a "download cursor" to keep track of where we are in this
// process, in a way that is independent of any one version. A cursor stores the
// level, a user key which is a lower bound for Smallest.UserKey within that
// level, and a sequence number which is a lower bound for the LargestSeqNum for
// files on that level starting at exactly that key.
//
// While a download task is running, tables with external backings can disappear
// due to excises or compactions; tables can move *down* (to a lower LSM level);
// or tables can have their bounds shrink due to excises (and these will appear
// as new tables, even though they have the same backing). The top-down,
// left-to-right-start-key ordering ensures that we don't miss any table
// (instead, we may examine it multiple times).
//
// We use a cursor that advances as our download task makes progress. Each time
// we encounter a file that needs downloading, we create a "bookmark". A
// bookmark conceptually represents a key range within a level and it
// corresponds to the bounds of the file that we discovered. It is represented
// as a cursor position (corresponding to the start) and an end boundary key. We
// need to remember the bookmark because the download compaction can fail (e.g.
// it can get canceled by an excise) and the file might get excised so we need
// to look again at all files within the original key range.
//
// It is also possible that we encounter files that are already part of a
// compaction. These can be move compaction, or can get canceled, so we can't
// just ignore these files; we create bookmarks for such files as well.
//
// We maintain no more than maxConcurrentDownloads bookmarks - the idea being
// that files that are part of compactions are getting downloaded anyway and we
// can effectively count them toward the limit. When we cannot create any more
// bookmarks, we stop advancing the task cursor. Note that it is not this code's
// job to enforce the maximum concurrency, this is simply a reasonable limit - we
// don't want to accumulate arbitrarily many bookmarks, since we check each one
// whenever tryLaunchDownloadCompaction is called (after every compaction
// completing).
//
// This implementation achieves O(maxConcurrentDownloads * N) level iterator
// operations across the entire task, where N is the (average) number of files
// within the bounds.
