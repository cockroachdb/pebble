// DB.mu. Instead, a separate DB.readState.RWMutex is used for
// synchronization. This mutex solely covers the current readState object which
// means it is rarely or ever contended.
//
// Note that various fancy lock-free mechanisms can be imagined for loading the
// readState, but benchmarking showed the ones considered to purely be
// pessimizations. The RWMutex version is a single atomic increment for the
// RLock and an atomic decrement for the RUnlock. It is difficult to do better
// than that without something like thread-local storage which isn't available
// in Go.
