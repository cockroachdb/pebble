Upgrading DB from internal version 1 to 16.
WARNING!!!
This DB will not be usable with older versions of Pebble!

It is strongly recommended to back up the data before upgrading.

If this DB uses custom block property collectors, the upgrade should be invoked
through a custom binary that configures them. Otherwise, any new tables created
during upgrade will not have the relevant block properties.
