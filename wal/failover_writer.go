// recordQueue is a variable-size single-producer multiple-consumer queue. It

// to grow the size, since there is no upper bound on the number of queued
// records (which are all the records that are not synced, and will need to be
// written again in case of failover). Additionally, it needs a mutex to
// atomically grab a snapshot of the queued records and provide them to a new
// LogWriter that is being switched to.
type recordQueue struct {
	// Only held for reading for all pop operations and most push operations.
	// Held for writing when buffer needs to be grown or when switching to a new
	// writer.
	mu sync.RWMutex

	// queue is [tail, head). tail is the oldest entry and head is the index for
	// the next entry.
	//
	// Consumers: atomically read and write tail in pop. This is not the usual
	// kind of queue consumer since they already know the index that they are
	// popping exists, hence don't need to look at head.
	//
	// Producer: atomically reads tail in push. Writes to head.
	//
	// Based on the above we only need tail to be atomic. However, the producer
	// also populates entries in buffer, whose values need to be seen by the
	// consumers when doing a pop, which means they need to synchronize using a
	// release and acquire memory barrier pair, where the push does the release
	// and the pop does the acquire. For this reason we make head also atomic
	// and merge head and tail into a single atomic, so that the store of head
	// in push and the load of tail in pop accomplishes this release-acquire
	// pair.
	//
	// We initially implemented competition between multiple consumers solely
	// via atomic read-write of the tail using compare-and-swap (CAS). Since the
	// atomic read-write to tail in pop releases those buffer entries for reuse
	// to the producer, the consumer needs to grab the contents of
	// recordQueueEntry that it needs to do callbacks etc. (specifically the
	// contents corresponding to poppedEntry), *before* it succeeds with the
	// atomic read-write. This introduced a false data race in the Golang data
	// race detector
	// https://github.com/cockroachdb/pebble/issues/3380#issuecomment-1981188174.
	// Consider the case where the queue is [10,20), and consumer C1 is trying
	// to pop [10,12) and consumer C2 is trying to pop [10,14). The following
	// interleaving can happen:
	//
	// [C1] reads head=10, tail=20
	// [C2] reads head=10, tail=20
	// [C1] reads buffer contents [10,12) and makes local copy
	// [C1] CAS to make the queue [12,20)
	// [C2] reads buffer contents [10,14) and makes local copy, concurrently
	//      with producer writing to 10, 11. *
	// [C2] CAS fails for popping [10,14), so revises to [12,14), and succeeds
	//      in CAS. C2 only uses the contents it read into the local copy for
	//      [12,14).
	//
	// * is a false data race since C2 is later deciding what contents it should
	// use from among the contents it read, based on what indices it
	// successfully popped. Unfortunately, we don't have a way to annotate the
	// code to tell the data race detector to ignore this false positive. So we
	// need to strengthen the synchronization to prevent such false positives.
	// We observe that usually a consumer will be popping a batch of entries
	// (based on a single successful fsync), and the number of consumers will be
	// small (usually 1). In comparison, producers can be highly concurrent (due
	// to workload concurrency). We don't want consumers to compete for a mutex
	// with producers, but we can afford to have multiple consumers compete for
	// a mutex. So we fix this false data race by using consumerMu to force
	// single-threaded popping.
	//
	// An alternative would be to pass the information contained in poppedEntry
	// to the LogWriter, so that it can pass it back when popping (so we don't
	// have to retrieve it from the recordQueue.buffer). We would still need
	// recordQueue.buffer, since writer switching needs those entries to be
	// replayed. We don't consider this solution for the same reason we replaced
	// record.pendingSyncsWithSyncQueue with
	// record.pendingSyncsWithHighestSyncIndex for the failoverWriter code path
	// -- we cannot bound the queue in the LogWriter by record.SyncConcurrency:
	// say SyncConcurrency was 4096, and LogWriter1's queue was full, and we
	// switched to LogWriter2, to which we replayed the same records and filled
	// up the queue. Then if LogWriter1 unblocks and pops all the 4096 entries,
	// the commit pipeline can send another 4096 entries, while LogWriter2 is
	// still blocked on trying to write and sync the previous 4096 entries. This
	// will overflow the queue in LogWriter2.
	//
	// All updates to headTail hold mu at least for reading. So when mu is held
	// for writing, there is a guarantee that headTail is not being updated.
