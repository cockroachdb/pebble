// recordQueue is a variable-size single-producer multiple-consumer queue. It

// to grow the size, since there is no upper bound on the number of queued
// records (which are all the records that are not synced, and will need to be

	// queue is [tail, head). tail is the oldest entry and head is the index for
	// the next entry.
	//
	// Consumers: atomically read and write tail in pop (using
	// compare-and-swap). This is not the usual kind of queue consumer since
	// they already know the index that they are popping exists, hence don't
	// need to look at head.
	//
	// Producer: atomically reads tail in push. Writes to head.
	//
	// Based on the above we only need tail to be atomic. However, the producer
	// also populates entries in buffer, whose values need to be seen by the
	// consumers when doing a pop, which means they need to synchronize using a
	// release and acquire memory barrier pair, where the push does the release
	// and the pop does the acquire. For this reason we make head also atomic
	// and merge head and tail into a single atomic, so that the store of head
	// in push and the load of tail in pop accomplishes this release-acquire
	// pair.
